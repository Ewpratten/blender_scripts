# My personal Blender scripts

This repo just contains some standalone blender scripts I use to automate little things in my work.

## Using

Just clone this repo, and add it as your scripts directory in `Edit > Preferences > File Paths > Scripts`. All add-ons will show up in the add-ons menu.

## Add-ons

- Positive Y Camera
  - Add a camera at origion facing positive Y through the `Shift+A` menu. Handy for 2D work
